            <span class="v1_6">The Boundary Fire was a 2017
                 wildfire in Arizona that burned 17,788 acres 
                 (7,199 ha) of the Coconino and Kaibab National 
                 Forests. The fire was ignited on June 1 when 
                 lightning struck a spot on the northeast side 
                 of Kendrick Peak within the Coconino National Forest. 
                 The fire spread rapidly because of high temperatures, 
                 steep terrain, leftovers from a wildfire in 2000, 
                 and high wind speeds. The winds blew smoke over local 
                 communities and infrastructure, leading to the closure 
                 of U.S. Route 180 from June 8 to June 21. Smoke was 
                 also visible from the Grand Canyon. The Boundary Fire 
                 burned out on July 3, 2017, after 32 days of 
                 firefighting. The cost of managing the fire was 
                 $9.4 million (equivalent to $11.5 million in 2023). 
                 Damage to the area's foliage increased the risk of 
                 landslides into 2018. The Boundary Fire was one of 
                 2,321 wildfires in Arizona in 2017 that burned a 
                 total of 429,564 acres (173,838 ha). (Full article...)
